# Malbasy
Locally hosted mock e-commerce clothing website made with HTML, CSS and PHP (using XAMPP) with some JS. Uses PHP sessions as a shopping cart and stores orders/purchases as cookies.

malbasy.sql file must be imported into the phpmyadmin DB using xampp in order to properly use the application.

Regarding the `order` and `order_products` tables, they keep track of orders but are not called when retrieving past purchases.
